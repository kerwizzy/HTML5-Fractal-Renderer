<h3>Fractals</h3>
<p>Fractals are shapes that include smaller features which resemble the fractal as a whole. These smaller shapes, in turn, include yet smaller "copies" of the larger figure.</p> 
<p> The Mandelbrot set is a fractal because it includes smaller shapes that look like the larger shape. Interestingly, though, the smaller features in the Mandelbrot set are always slightly different than the larger fractal.</p>

<h3>About the Mandelbrot Set</h3>
<p>The Mandelbrot set (and the other fractals displayed here) are made by repeating a function over and over again.</p>
<p>For example, in order to find the color for a location in the Mandelbrot Set, first we take the location and make it a number in the <a class="link" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane>complex plane</a>. We call this number “c”.</p>
<p>Then, we use the equation for the Mandelbrot Set that tells us, given a number in an interation sequence, and c, we can calculate the next value in the sequence.</p>
<p>So, basically, we calculate “sequences” of numbers for each location, using this equation:</p>

<p>z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c</p>
<p>Where</p>
<ul>
<li><b>c</b> is the complex number</li>
<li><b>n</b> is what location in the sequence we are at.</li>

<li><b>z<sub>n</sub></b> is the n<sup>th</sup> number in the sequence. (That is, the current number)</li>

<li><b>z</b><sub>n+1</sub>is the n+1<sup>th</sup> number in the sequence. (That is, the next number.) </li>

</ul>

<p>So simply written, the equation is:</p>
<p><i>Next number = previous number squared + location</i></p>
<p>We set the starting number to 0, and then we can calculate sequences. These sequences allow us to figure out how to color things.</p>
<p>Here's how that works. Suppose we wanted to find the color at 1,0 (x =1, y=0). We would turn that into a complex number. (1+0i, or just 1.) and make that c.</p>
<p>Then we would place that into the equation, setting z0 = 0 and get:</p>
<p>z<sub>1</sub> = 0<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 1.</p>
<p>So z<sub>1</sub> = 1</p>
<p>Then we would place that in the equation again and get:</p>
<p>z<sub>2</sub> = 1<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 2</p>
<p>And find that for c = 1, z<sub>2</sub> = 2.</p>
<p>Continuing this process would produce the sequence:</p>
<p><i>0, 1, 2, 5, 26…</i></p>
<p>Which would get larger and larger indefinitely. </p>
<p>Now here's how we find the colors. The Mandelbrot “set” is defined to be all the locations (values of c) that produce a sequence that does <b>not</b> get larger and larger. Usally, all number in the set are colored black. But how do we find the color of something that is not in the set?</p>
<p>Let's go back to our example of c = 1. We set that if the number gets larger than a limit value (usually 2) then we will stop “iterating”, (that is, calculating more values in the sequence) the number. Then, we find the count how many iterations it took for the number to “escape”, or get larger than the limit.</p>
<p>So since setting c = 1 took 2 iterations to go beyond the limit, we would color that location what ever color corresponds to “2” in the color palette we're using.</p>
Now what about numbers that <b>don't</b> go beyond the limit, and are in the set? How do we even know they won't go beyond the limit, if we only keep iterating them? This is actually a hard problem. Some numbers would be very easy to tell. For example, setting c = -1 gives the sequence:</p>
<p><i>0, -1, 0, -1, 0...</i></p></p>
<p>Since this obviously repeats, and does not ever go beyond 2, then it is in the set, and just needs to be colored black. But some numbers may not repeat. In fact, what most programs (including this one) do in order to find if something is “in the set”, simply keep on running the iteration function for a fixed number of iterations. (The default here is 30,000. It can be changed using the input above.) If the number does not “escape”, that is, go over the limit, by the end, then it decides it is in the set, and colors that location black.</p>
<p>Not having enough iterations can be a problem, though. For instance, try reducing the number of iterations to 10, or 100 using the box above. See how the look changes. In some places, 30,000, or ever 100,000 iterations isn't even enough to display the set perfectly! It can be a problem that there is no definite way to say if something is “in” the set (unless it repeates).</p>

<h3>About the Burning Ship Fractal</h3>
<p>The burning ship fractal is closely related to the Mandelbrot set. The only difference is that the real and imaginary parts of the number are changed to thier absolute values (that is, if they are negative, they are changed to positive) before each iteration.</p>

<h3>About the Mandelbar fractal</h3>
<p>This fractal (also called the Tricorn) is made by iterating the function:
<p>z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>-2</sup> + c</p>
<p>as opposed to:
<p>z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c</p>
<p> for the Mandelbrot Set.
<p>One can find both copies of the large Mandelbar and "squashed" features that look like the regular Mandelbrot Set.</p>

<h3>About Fractal Renderer</h3>
<p>Fractal Renderer was written by Kerwizzy (Age 13), with help from his father.</p>
<p>He made it because he wanted to be able to explore other fractals that he had heard about, such as the Burning Ship fractal, and try seeing if he could find other fractals. </p>
<p>He wrote the program and designed the page himself (with some techical help from his father). He made all the color palettes himself, too, using tools in <a class="link" href=https://www.blender.org/>Blender 3D</a>. (With some ideas for names from other renderers.)</p>
<p>He is happy with the Fractal Renderer, but he thinks there are more improvements to be made!</p>
